this is a simple aurduino distance sensor I built.
It uses the Aurduino Uno R3 as a microcontroller 
It uses the HC-SR04 as an ultrasonic device (Sender and Reiceiver)
It uses 5 5mm LEDs and 1k resistors for each.
It could have a buzzer atached to it for proximity sounds, or atached and played with I dont know i just thought it was cool.
